// The ripples are Now Playing's background as black water at night, with
// the cover darkly under it: the colors of the cover, blurred, seen
// through a slow swell that never stops, and now and then a ring
// widening from where a drop fell, its crests catching the light as it
// passes. The water bends what is under it, so the cover moves as the
// rings go over it, rather than the rings lying on the cover.
//
// Like the fog and the stars, it is a shader, so that the CPU may paint
// it small and once a song, and the GPU paint it half the window across,
// moving, thirty times a second while the music plays.

// rippleSource paints it: the cover, blurred, read through the water's
// bend, darkened by the depth of the water and lit along the crests of
// the rings.
