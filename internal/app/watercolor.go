// The watercolor is Now Playing's background as a sheet of dark paper with
// the cover's colors washed over it: three inks, each its own hue near the
// cover's, bleeding into the paper and into each other, their edges
// gathering where they dry, the paper's grain showing through.
//
// It is wet, so it moves: the pigment is carried along by currents of its
// own, each wash's wet front creeps outward and draws back again as the
// paper takes water and dries, and now and then a drop lands in the wet
// paper and pushes the ink out in a ring that widens and thins away. The
// bass opens the washes a little wider and quickens the rings.
//
// Like the fog and the stars, it is a shader, so that the CPU may paint it
// small and once a song, and the GPU paint it half the window across,
// moving, thirty times a second while the music plays.

// waterSource paints it: noise of four octaves, warped by noise of its own
// so that the washes bleed rather than slide, and at each wash's rim the
// ink gathers darker, as watercolor does when it dries.
