// The record is Now Playing's background as a turntable in a dark room: a
// disc of black vinyl standing out from behind the cover, its grooves
// turning slowly, the light of the room lying across it in two soft
// bands, and a little dust caught in the grooves, going round with it.
//
// Like the fog and the stars, it is a shader, so that the CPU may paint it
// small and once a song, and the GPU paint it half the window across,
// moving, thirty times a second while the music plays.

// vinylSource paints it: the dark of the room, the disc, and the light
// over both. It turns with Time; its grooves are near enough rings, and
// the dust in them and the wobble of their spacing are what turn. Scale is
// how many of the canvas's pixels a window's DIP is, for the grooves to
// stay the same width whatever the canvas is painted at — and where the
// canvas is too coarse to hold them, the grooves and the dust give way to
// a plain disc.
